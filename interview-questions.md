# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: Conditional statements are "if" statements in JavaScript where if the defined statement is true, it will run the code that is inside the block. There can be more than one if statements, and the code will run repeatedly until a true statement is brought back.

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that tracks changes to coding files used by software developers. The difference between Git and GitHub is that GitHub is the site that is used to upload those changes made for filekeeping.

Researched answer: Git is a DevOps tool used for code source management to track changes in the source code, enabling multple developers to work on a single project at once. GitHub, however is a site that is cloud-based that actually allows the user to MANAGE these Git repositories that were created.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The operators of "||"(or) and "&&"(and) will return a boolean value.

Researched answer: The local operators of OR(||), AND(&&), and NOT(!) will return a boolean value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the number that is assigned to the listed item in an array that starts at the zero index value, whereas the value is the listed data type within that array. The difference is that values are the items within the array, and index is the hidden number assigned to that value within the array -- it is not displayed, but can be called to see what index number it corresponds to.

Researched answer: Index is a number that indicate where in a certain JavaScript object, certain location, of piece of information is stored. The major difference between an index and value is that "index" refers to the index of the current array element and is an OPTIONAL parameter whereas "value" shows the current element of the array and it is REQUIRED.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are a data type that can hold a collection of similiar data types, and can hold a string within it VS a string cannot hold multiple data types as its a primitive data type at it's core. Similarities include the ability to hold characters inside it, but differences between them is that strings are a single data type, and an array is a collection, or miltiple data type.

Researched answer: An array is a listed ordered collection of data types used to store multiple values within a single variable. A string is a a primitive data type that holds text in many forms. Similarities they share is that they both can contain characters, however, the key differences is that with arrays, it can hold a collection of elements that share the same data type whereas a string is limited to just characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques involves two coders, or programmers working side by side to complete a project. One programmer will act as the "driver", while the other will take on the "navigator" role. As the role of the driver, you will be the one in control of typing out the code, executing the code in terminal, and ensuring that you are following the given directions from your navigator. Whereas the role of the navigator is to give the plannable action or directions to the driver. The navigator will often times be another set of eyes to the driver to verify any mispellings, and reviewing over anything that could potentially mess up their code. Proper pair programming will ensure that both users will be able to experience both roles, and will swap these roles dependent on what was agreed upon.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique in software development where two programmers work together within one workstation. There are two roles, the driver and the navigator. The driver codes, while the navigator reviews the driver's codes as it is being typed in, line-by-line. While reviewing, the navigator will think strategically and think upon improvements for the direction of the work for the purpose of avoiding any future problems. This allows the driver to shift all their focus and attention to tactical aspects of the task and to use their navigator as a guide and safety net. The two programmers working together will often switch roles.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that accepts functions as a parameter and/or return a function

2. Jest: Jest is JavaScipt-based framework for testing React, Reactive Native, and other JavasScripted based applications.

3. Objects: Objects are a collection of properties or related data and/or functionalities.

4. Method: Methods are specific actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

5. Classes: Classes are used as a template for creating objects, encapsulating data with code to work on that specific data.
